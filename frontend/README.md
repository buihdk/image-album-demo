# Image Album

## Notes
- Please include webp file in ALLOWED_DATAROOM_EXTENSIONS so you can upload image files with .webp extension.
- I am using Prettier (together with ESLint) instead of Standard.js for linting and formatting. It seems to me that Prettier and Standard.js are very similar with each other (with a few minor differences) so we can just use one of the two for linting/formatting code. I did not add Standard.js since it's not required but I'm happy to install the package and follow its conventions.
